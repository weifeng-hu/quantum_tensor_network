# QTN(quantum tensor network)

A scalable quantum simulation library

Features:
* Aiming for the quantum "neural-network" machine learning.
* A stochastic gradient-descent descent learning

Roadmaps:
* A middle layer asynchronous queue system for distributed computing
* OpenMP and GPU support
* A more complete tensor library for high order tensor operations
